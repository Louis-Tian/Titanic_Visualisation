# Surviving Titanic - A Visual Exploration

## SUMMARY
This is a simple data visualization demo powered by `d3.js` using the Titanic passenger data obtained
from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)


## Design
The tragedy of Titanic is a well know story. It has a strong and natural story line. This visualization is
designed around this story line. My goal is to create a visualization that feels like watching a movie.

Each passenger is encoded by a small circle.

The gender of each passenger encoded by the color hue as well as the horizontal position. Males are
organized at the left hand side of the entire scene and Female on the right.    

The age of the passenger is also encoded by the horizontal position from left to right in ascending order.

Whether a passenger survived tragedy is encoded in by the vertical position as well as the opacity.

This visualization make heavy use of the animation. It has 4 separate stages (scene),
each one is connected from the previous one using animation. The animated is used to enhance the
visual encoding and gives each scene a very strong focus.

I complemented the visualization with animated text scripts to make the entire page more appealing.
